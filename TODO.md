## 🔴 P0 — Security & Critical

- No open issue carries `P0`, and there are **0 open code-scanning alerts**.
- **23 open Dependabot alerts are currently untracked by any issue** (1 critical, 12 high, 10 medium). By decision on 2026-07-28 they were deliberately **not** bridged into tracking issues — the 16 open Dependabot PRs are expected to clear most of them on merge. Re-run `/pstatus` after that sweep and bridge only what survives.
  - `go.mod` — HIGH `golang.org/x/image` (GHSA-q675-qj96-32m9). Only alert with real runtime exposure; fix is merging [#390](https://github.com/jwilleke/yourphr/pull/390).
  - `frontend/yarn.lock` (22) — critical `websocket-driver`; high `brace-expansion`, `js-yaml`, `shell-quote`, `fast-uri`, `linkify-it`, `immutable`, `engine.io`; medium `webpack-dev-server`, `tar`, `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `morgan`. These are build/dev-chain transitives that do not ship in the served image — exposure is a developer machine, not patient data.
