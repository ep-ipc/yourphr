# Legal documents

The Privacy Policy and Terms of Service moved out of the docs tree in [#463](https://github.com/jwilleke/yourphr/issues/463), and moved again when the Go stack was deleted ([#677](https://github.com/jwilleke/yourphr/issues/677)). They are no longer markdown files: they are string constants in [`src/legal/shipped.ts`](../../src/legal/shipped.ts), so the build carries them with no asset step.

They live beside the Go package because they are __embedded into the binary__ with `go:embed`, which cannot reach outside its own package directory. Embedding is what lets an instance serve its own policy with no external dependency — an offline home server still shows its terms, and there is no file to forget to mount.
