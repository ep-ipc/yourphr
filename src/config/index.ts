/**
 * The configuration vocabulary (yourphr#542, reshaped by yourphr#621, #629).
 *
 * There is no catalogue here any more. ngdpbase holds 579 keys as flat values with `_comment_*`
 * siblings for documentation and NO per-key metadata structure; Go's admin `ConfigEntry` carries no
 * description field either. The compiled `ConfigCatalog` was ours alone, and it cost what a second
 * list always costs: two edits per key, a boot check to keep the halves agreeing, and — the one
 * that mattered — metadata an operator could not see. Somebody sets a key, nothing happens, and the
 * reason is a flag compiled into `dist/`. That is the failure yourphr#473 exists to prevent, one
 * level up: on the metadata instead of the key.
 *
 * What a key means now lives where its value lives — `config/app-default-config.json`, which ships
 * with the release. Two lists in that file carry the only behaviour that is not simply a value, and
 * both are Go's, by name, by shape and by reasoning:
 *
 *   yourphr.public   an ALLOW-list — a mistake exposes a value to the internet
 *   yourphr.secret   a DENY-list  — a mistake shows a value to an already-authenticated admin
 *
 * The rules the layers serve, each with its reason:
 *
 *   - Three layers, strict precedence: environment > instance overrides > shipped defaults. The
 *     environment carries bootstrap and secrets only; everything else is a setting.
 *   - The overrides hold only what the operator changed — never the merged view. Writing the merged
 *     view would freeze today's defaults into the instance forever, so a later release that changed
 *     a default would silently not apply. ngdpbase shipped that bug (its #895).
 *   - A key pinned by the environment is READ-ONLY to set(): env wins at read time, so accepting
 *     the write would store a value that never applies. Go's config screen answers 409 likewise.
 *   - Unknown override keys are REPORTED, never silently carried or dropped (yourphr#473). The
 *     shipped file IS the list of known keys, so nothing extra is needed to detect one.
 */

/**
 * A structured setting — a JSON object whose leaves are ordinary values. ngdpbase carries its
 * permission registry and role definitions this way, and the merge handles one PER ENTRY rather
 * than whole-value, so overriding one entry does not freeze the rest against everything shipped
 * afterwards.
