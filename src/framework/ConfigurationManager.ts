/**
 * Configuration as a manager (yourphr#608, #609; reshaped by yourphr#621) — first in every boot
 * order, because everything else reads it.
 *
 * This manager owns the POLICY: the three layers and their precedence, the merge, the catalogue of
 * what each key means, and the refusals (unknown key, bootstrap key, env-pinned key). A
 * `BaseConfigProvider` behind it owns only the STORAGE — fetch the two layers, persist the
 * overrides. That split is deliberate: a provider that could implement its own precedence is a
 * provider that could get it wrong, and "which layer wins" must not vary by where the bytes live.
 *
 * THE BOOTSTRAP EXCEPTION, stated rather than assumed: every other capability in this stack is
 * selected BY configuration (`yourphr.audit.provider`, `yourphr.backup.storage.provider`). This one cannot be —
 * it is what reads configuration. Its provider is chosen by the composition root, from the same
 * place the data directory and the database key already come from. Ratified 2026-08-23.
 *
 * backup() carries the overrides (what the operator changed), never the environment — secrets and
 * bootstrap values are the deployment's, not the backup's.
