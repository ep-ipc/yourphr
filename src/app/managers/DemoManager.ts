/**
 * Demo mode (yourphr#643): the shared account a public demo signs every visitor into, the one-click
 * entrance that does it, and the restriction that makes the arrangement safe.
 *
 * Three facts, one owner. Go spread them over `pkg/demo` (provisioning), an auth handler (the
 * entrance) and a middleware (the restriction), and the three had to agree about what "the demo
 * account" means. Here they are one manager, because they are one rule read three ways: THIS
 * instance is a demo, THIS account is the demo's, and that account may not bring outside data in.
 *
 * WHY THE CREDENTIAL IS GENERATED. `POST /api/auth/demo-signin` posts nothing — the server verifies
 * the configured password against the stored hash and mints the session — so no visitor ever needs
 * to know one. A human-chosen value bought only the ability to type it at the sign-in form, which
 * nobody does, and it cost twice in Go: the seeded `demo123` was shorter than the product's own
 * minimum (yourphr#505), and its replacement collided with the policy that forbids the username
 * inside the password (yourphr#506). A value shipped inside a public image is a published
 * credential identical on every deployment; generated per instance, it is neither.
 *
 * WHY THE VERIFY SURVIVES. Minting a token for whoever `yourphr.demo.username` names would be
 * simpler and would turn one mis-set flag into an auth bypass: demo mode switched on by an operator
 * exploring the Configuration screen, on an instance that happens to hold an account called `demo`,
 * would hand a stranger that account's records. The configured password must verify against the
 * stored hash, so a flag flipped without provisioning does nothing at all.
 *
 * NOT FATAL AT BOOT. A demo that cannot provision is a demo with no way in — worth a loud log line,
 * not worth refusing to start over. Contrast the bootstrap admin (yourphr#504), where failing to
 * provision leaves an instance reachable and unowned.
