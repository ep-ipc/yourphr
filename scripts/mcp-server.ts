/**
 * YourPHR as an MCP server (yourphr#657) — the patient's own AI client reads their own records.
 *
 *   YOURPHR_URL=http://localhost:8080 YOURPHR_AGENT_TOKEN=yphr_at_… npm run mcp
 *
 * A patient mints an agent token for themselves (yourphr#695), scoped to `Record search`, and hands
 * it to an AI client they already run. The client launches this bridge; the bridge asks YourPHR's
 * own HTTP API the same question the dashboard's search box asks. YourPHR transmits nothing to
 * anyone: the record goes to the client the patient chose, under the patient's own credential.
 *
 * WHY A BRIDGE RATHER THAN A ROUTE, which is the whole design and the reason this is small:
 *
 * The agent-token gate in server.ts is default-deny — an agent reaches a GET whose path has an
 * access category and whose category its token names, and nothing else. Presenting the token to
 * that surface inherits scoping, auditing and read-only *for free*. An MCP endpoint inside the
 * server could not: JSON-RPC is a POST, every POST is refused there, so it would have to sit
 * outside the gate and re-implement all three — the "beside it rather than on top of it" mistake.
 *
 * It also cannot live under src/ even if we wanted it to: `check:boundary` refuses `fetch` there,
 * because Node's fetch is undici and ignores the guarded DNS lookup that is the SSRF control.
 * scripts/ is the exempt place for loopback drivers, and that exemption is why this lives here —
 * the same reason scripts/agent-token-tests.ts does.
 *
 * So this process holds no database handle, no session, and no privilege. It is an HTTP client with
 * a scoped bearer token, and every safety property it has belongs to the server it calls.
 *
 * WHAT IT PUBLISHES: one read-only TOOL (`search_records`), seven RESOURCES — the categorised GET
 * routes an agent token can already reach — and three PROMPTS. The last two are what a client's
 * attachment picker lists, and publishing neither is why the first slice appeared in no picker.
 *
 * ZERO DEPENDENCIES, deliberately. The official SDK would be the conventional choice, but MCP's
 * stdio transport is newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 and the surface used here is a handful of
 * methods. In a
 * store of medical records, a dependency tree is a standing supply-chain question, and this repo
 * runs on sixteen packages. If the maintainers would rather take the SDK, the shape below is the
 * same either way — only the plumbing changes.

 * The first slice published one tool and nothing else, which is why YourPHR did not appear in a
 * client's attachment picker at all: that menu lists RESOURCES and PROMPTS, and this server had
 * neither. A tool answers a question the model thought to ask; a resource is the patient handing
 * over a document deliberately, which is the more honest shape for "here are my medications".
 *
 * Every entry is a GET that already has an access category, so the same default-deny gate decides
 * it and the same access-log line records it. The `scope` field is not enforced here — it is what
 * the server will demand, repeated so a refusal can name the exact thing to tick when minting.
 *
 * The list is STATIC and deliberately not filtered to the token's own scopes: an agent token
 * cannot read its own record (managing one needs the owner's session), and probing each route to
 * find out would write an access-log line for every resource the patient never asked for. So all
 * of them are offered, and one the token does not carry refuses by name when it is read.
