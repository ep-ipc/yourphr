// This deployment's effective SMART on FHIR OAuth relay settings, served by
// GET /secure/source/relay-config (#399, extended in #402). The relay is a deployment concern, so
// these values come from the backend at runtime — they are NOT compiled into the frontend bundle.

// Where a resolved value came from. The operator-facing question is rarely "is this URL right" but
// "is my configuration being read at all" — a value that silently fell back to a default looks
// identical to one set on purpose, which is what made #399 and #397 hard to diagnose.
